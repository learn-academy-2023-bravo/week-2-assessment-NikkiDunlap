# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is the variable that we define in a function declaration. They control the way the function is ran. They are like a template. It sets the stage (expectations) for the function. An argument is the variable given to the function for execution. It is the real value input that we give in hopes to get the output we want.

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable that is part of the function declaration or expression, while an argument is a value that is passed to a function when it is called.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The predefined parameters of .map() are currentValue, index, and array. currentValue is required; however, index and array are optional.

Researched answer: The .map() method is used to create a new array by calling a provided function on every element in the original array. The provided function takes three parameters: currentValue, index, and array to create values in a new array. Index and array are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Map creates a brand new array by performing the action on each item in an array; however, it does not change the original array. Filter creates a new array with values that are being tested.

Researched answer: Map returns an array of pieces of information from the original array. In the callback function, return the data you wish to be part of the new array. Filter returns a subset of the original array based on custom criteria.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the process of a method operating on every single item in an array. Built-in methods like forEach(), map(), and filter() are good examples of this. 

Researched answer: Iteration is the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a certain condition is met.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: Functions stand alone and perform a specific task, but methods are associated with a specific class. Methods manipulate the data of that class

Researched answer: A function in JavaScript is a standalone block of code that can be called from anywhere in the code. A method is a function that is defined as a property of an object and can only be called on instances of that object.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting is when all declarations are moved to the top of the function, no matter where the variables are placed within the code. 

Researched answer: the behavior where variable declarations and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes, before the actual code execution.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

2. Spread operator: allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React state: where you store property values that belongs to the component.

4. React props: Props are arguments passed into React components.

5. DOM events: the action that takes place when a user clicks a link on a webpage.
